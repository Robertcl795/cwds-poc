# Phase 2.5 Non-Breaking API Cleanup

## Canonical naming
- `helperText` is canonical.
- `errorText` is canonical.

## Legacy aliases kept for compatibility
- `helper` -> alias for `helperText`
- `validationMessage` -> alias for `errorText`

## Notes
- No breaking removals in Phase 2.5.
- Alias removal is deferred until Phase 4+ after ecosystem usage audit.
