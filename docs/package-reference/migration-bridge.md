# @ds/migration-bridge

## Purpose and boundary

Provide compatibility wrappers to migrate legacy consumers incrementally.
Owns deprecation aliases and migration telemetry hooks.

## Public API surface

- Current state: placeholder package (`src/index.ts` empty)
- Intended: legacy-shaped wrapper exports around DS primitives/adapters

## Usage examples

Vanilla:
```ts
// Pending bridge API implementation
```

Angular 19+:
```ts
// Pending bridge API implementation
```

## Known POC limitations

- No functional bridge APIs implemented yet.
- Migration telemetry and adapter fallback strategy not defined.

## Future extension points

- Implement first facades for top migrated legacy components.
- Add deprecation metadata and removal dates per facade.
